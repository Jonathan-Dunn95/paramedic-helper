This will, eventually, be an application for use by Paramedics in the Stokes County EMS system. 
Each EMS agency has their treatment protocols outlined in a massive, heavy, and not-easily-navigable binder and a binder is placed on each ambulance 
in order to reference in the event the Paramedic needs a refresher or reminder about specific treatment guidelines 
such as medications, dosages, medication mixing, procedure steps, etc.

This app will make finding and accessing the specific protocol needed much faster and easier by eliminating the need to flip through a the aforementioned binder.
Additionally, I plan to eventually make this into an Android and iOS app with the PDFs stored locally on the device due to poor cellular reception in Stokes County.
